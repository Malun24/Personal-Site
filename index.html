    <h1 style=" color: whitesmoke;" class="header">Can't spell "Heart" without "Art"</h1>
    <p1 style="color: whitesmoke;">I believe if everyone had the positive motivating mindset then they can get things
        done without fearing failure. We all make mistakes, it makes us better.</p1>
    <p1 style="color: whitesmoke;">I go out my way and find a new hobby within my interest so other than drawing, I do
        the following</p1>
    <section></section>
    <ul style="color: whitesmoke;">
        <li>Paint</li>
        <li>Customize clothing</li>
        <li>Tattooing</li>
    </ul>
    <p2 style="color: whitesmoke;">I still believe there's more for me to learn and that it's never too late to
        experiment about myself and get my
        hands even more dirty</p2>
    <section></section>
    <p2 style="color: whitesmoke;">With art being my talent, it comes with pros and cons. one of my major con is I
        always change things around because i feel it looks too "plain.</p2>
    <section></section>
    <p2 style="color: whitesmoke;">One major pro with me being creative is that my work is eye catching. I love to stand
        out without doing anything, I let my work ethic speak for me.</p2>
